    MOSDAC (Meteorological and Oceanographic Satellite Data Archival Centre) is India's premier facility for satellite data archival and distribution. Established by ISRO, MOSDAC serves as the central repository for meteorological and oceanographic satellite data.

    The center processes data from various Indian satellites including INSAT series, Oceansat, Scatsat-1, and international satellites. MOSDAC provides near real-time data products for weather forecasting, cyclone monitoring, and climate studies.

    Key services include:
    1. Data archival and retrieval systems
    2. Near real-time data dissemination
    3. Value-added products for weather and ocean applications
    4. Training and capacity building programs
    5. Research and development in satellite meteorology

    MOSDAC supports various user communities including meteorological departments, research institutions, and operational agencies. The center maintains high-quality standards for data processing and ensures continuous availability of critical satellite data for weather and climate applications.

    Recent developments include advanced data processing algorithms, machine learning applications for weather prediction, and enhanced data visualization tools. MOSDAC continues to evolve with technological advancements to better serve the scientific community.
